### About the site:
This is my personal website, which is currently hosted at [Heroku](http://djgrill.herokuapp.com). The final public domain will be **[djgrill.com](http://djgrill.com)**.

### About the repository:
- The repository's master branch is always syncronized with the Heroku's master branch.
- The repository's dev branch is always the latest version of the site (normally ahead the master branch).
- All other branches are local.

### Local repositories:
- Branches starting with dev/ are related with JS, backend, bugfixes, performance improvements...
- Branches starting with ui/ are related with UI.

### Commits:
- Commit message ends with the related issue's number (see [this](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation)).
- Always include modified files in commit message (don't use commit -m).
- Always merge from dev and master using the --no-ff option.
